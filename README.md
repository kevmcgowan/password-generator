# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Overview

This week’s challenge required me to create application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. 

## Instructions

The following images shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
